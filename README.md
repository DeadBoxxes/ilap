# ilap
*ilap low level programming language*, its free to use! just please remember to update it when any changes are made to this site

ilap originally stood for something but i forgot... oops?
if you want to credit me go ahead! but its not nessisary, programming is something that shoul d be public domain, so aslong as you are not crediting this language as your own, then im completley ok with you making things that use my language!
# facts
some elements of this language are similar to most old languages, however, **im trying to keep this language as simple as possible**, one thing is that i dont really reccomend this for any programming games though, mostly just terminal stuff, or programs, maybe even text adventures, but i think making games with this is torturing yourself, theres no reason you should use this for games unless you hate yourself, just stick to making fun passsion projects :)... they are always better anyways...

i *also* do not mind anyone who makes modifications to my language to their hearts content, like i said, this language is free to use so make your own versions of it if you like, just take C for example, **too many variants...**
thats really all, find stuff, stuff, and tutorials on my language on the website!

i purposely used no (or very little) css as i want to make this site every browser friendly.... no javascript either as i know the 3ds browser doesnt support it...so to anyone who wants to use the web on your 3ds... **you are in luck!**
