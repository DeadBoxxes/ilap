  hi! i'm deadboxxes, i'm the creator of ilap, ilap is designed to be a simple, very basic, and easy to learn...<br>you might be asking, <i>why did you make ilap?</i> and to that I say, I made it because I have always wanted to make a programming language before... the thought of other people using my language has always
  stuck in my mind, and so i decided to dop that. Ilap is not a low level language, as you arent  working with the actual system, but its also not high level as ilap is designed to be mostly for text based stuff, like making programs for DOS-based computers... or extremley simple items, like calculators. <br>
  there is no proper way to program in ilap yet, <i>but</i> if anyone wants to make an ilap utility, feel free to... ilap is open for everyone.
